##### NOTE
I have not tested this on android for time being. Please let me know if in case if you find any issues

I am working on a fix, where user is not navigated to home after successful login attempt in the [saga](https://github.com/trinadhkoya/react-native-reddit-clone/tree/feature/with-saga
) branch 

For saga related work please check out [this](https://github.com/trinadhkoya/react-native-reddit-clone/tree/feature/with-saga
) branch.
